Edge Bundling for Visualizing Communication Behavior
====================================================

Supplemental material for "Edge Bundling for Visualizing Communication Behavior" submitted to the [Workshop on Visual Performance Analysis](http://www.cedmav.org/events/vpa-2016.html) at [Super Computing Conference 2016](http://sc16.supercomputing.org/)

- All traces are OTF traces (https://tu-dresden.de/zih/otf)
- I do not intend to distribute the source code used for the edge bundling, because it's a huge mess. If you still want it, please contact me.
- My personal OTF and OTF2 reader for this project is included ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license)
