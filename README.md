Supplemental material for "Edge Bundling for Visualizing Communication Behavior" submitted to the Workshop on Visual Performance Analysis at Super Computing Conference 2016

- All traces are OTF traces (https://tu-dresden.de/zih/otf)
- I do not intend to distribute the source code used for the edge bundling, because it's a huge mess. If you still want it, please contact me.
